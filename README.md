# Health and Economic Impact of Weather Events in US
This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major
storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as
well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

## Synopsis
The analysis on the storm event database revealed that tornadoes are the most
dangerous weather event to the population health. The second most dangerous
event type is the excessive heat. The economic impact of weather events was
also analyzed. Flash floods and thunderstorm winds caused billions of dollars
in property damages between 1950 and 2011. The largest crop damage caused by
drought, followed by flood and hails.
